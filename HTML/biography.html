				Biography
			</h1>

			<p>
				I was born in Harderwijk, in 1989. I play rugby and like to eat anything apart from bananas.
			</p>

			<p>
				I learned to write HTML and CSS by following tutorials on the internet and later by simple trial and error. I still have to ask a lot of things to Danko.
